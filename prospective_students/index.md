# Interested in working with me?

## **Preliminaries**

Please [read](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/preparation.html) this note for prospective students and review my research page. This should give you a good idea of expectations for machine learning research in my lab.

## **Postdocs**

I am not planning on additional postdocs for the 2023-2024 academic year.

## **Graduate students applying to Stanford**

I apologize that I am no longer able to respond to individual inquiries. Stanford CS graduate student admissions are by committee. It may be helpful to indicate your interest in working with me as part of your application.

## **Current Stanford students**

**Undergraduate Students:** Most undergraduate students join us through existing organized research programs, including [LINXS](https://cs.stanford.edu/linxs), [CURIS](https://curis.stanford.edu/), and [PURE](https://curis.stanford.edu/pure_student/). When possible, we also participate in [DREU](https://cra.org/cra-wp/dreu/). You may also consider contacting Ph.D. students in my lab.
**Graduate Students:** I am happy to discuss research if our interests align. Please contact me by email with your CV and a brief note on how our interests might overlap.

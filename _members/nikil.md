Iâ€™m a first year CS PhD student at Stanford University. I recently graduated from UCLA majoring in CS and Math, and I was fortunate to be advised by Guy Van Den Broeck at the Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence (StarAI) lab.

My primary research interests lie in probabilistic modeling, learning, and inference. I also deeply care about building towards trustworthy AI, and my research often touches on my interests in fairness, robustness, and explainability in probabilistic models.

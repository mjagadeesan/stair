I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Sanmi Koyejo. I am broadly interested in
Machine Learning: broadly in understanding and designing machine learning algorithms, especially from a fundamental perspective.
Optimization: non-convex optimization, combinatorial optimization, stochastic optimization, submodular optimization.
Algorithms: approximation algorithms, heuristic algorithms.

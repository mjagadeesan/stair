My current work as a postdoc primarily lies in the area of machine learning. I am mostly interested in theoretical work that: 1) helps us better understand the empirical success of such a fascinating technological field, and 2) helps us design better machine learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees. I am also interested in applications of machine learning and control to robotics.

I am an Applied Scientist (II) at Amazon (Search Science and AI). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I was advised by Prof. Sanmi Koyejo. Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I pursued integrated masters in Mathematics and Scientific Computing from IIT Kanpur and worked at Adobe Research, India for two years. I primarily work in statistical machine learning with a focus on metric elicitation and optimization, fairness, ranking, and recommender systems.

I am a third-year graduate student at EECS@MIT supervised by Prof. Gregory Wornell. I obtained my bacholor of science degree in computer engineering at UIUC, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yoram Bresler and Prof. Sanmi Koyejo.
I have broad interests in general machine learning problems, with a particular focus on trustworthy learning, including but not limited to topics like uncertainty quantification, fairness, and interpretability of large language model (LLM). I'm also interested in tackling/analyzing ML problems using tools/techniques in information theory.

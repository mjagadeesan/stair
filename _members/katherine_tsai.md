Katherine Tsai is a visiting researcher at Stanford and a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Dr. Sanmi Koyejo. Her research interests lie broadly at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics and optimization. Her current research focuses on developing efficient algorithms to estimate the graphs of stochastic processes, which can be applied to understand brain networks. She is the recipient of NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
Previously, she completed masterâ€™s degree at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and undergraduate studies at National Taiwan University, both in Electrical and Computer Engineering. She was a student intern at Google Brain and Intel AI lab.

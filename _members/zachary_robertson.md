I am Zachary Robertson, a CS PhD student at Stanford working primarily on scalable oversight. My research draws from mechanism design, information theory, and complex systems to create principled frameworks for human-AI collaboration. Prior to Stanford, I obtained a master's in CS from UIUC and a bachelor's in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Chicago. My industry experience includes internships at Google Brain, Lam Research where I optimized semiconductor wafer production, and robotics research at Toyota Technological Institute Chicago (TTIC).

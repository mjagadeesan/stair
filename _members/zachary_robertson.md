I am a CS Ph.D. student at Stanford. I obtained a Masters degree in CS from UIUC. My undergraduate major was Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of Chicago. I have a variety of research interests in machine learning. I’m particularly motivated by questions around creating human-compatible AI. I’m interested in scalable oversight, learning theory, and generative models as well.

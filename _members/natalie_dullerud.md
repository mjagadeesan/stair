I am a rising second-year Ph.D. student at Stanford University. I previously completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of Toronto and my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Southern California, with minors in Chemistry and Computer Science. My research interests have spanned statistical learning theory; algorithmic fairness and equity in machine learning; differential privacy; representation learning; optimization; and applications of machine learning in the healthcare and biological domains. I continue to be motivated by a broad range of topics and research questions under the general umbrella of mathematics and machine learning.

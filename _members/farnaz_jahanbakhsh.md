Iâ€™m joining the Computer Science and Engineering department at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor as an assistant professor, starting fall 2024.

Currently, I'm a postdoc at Stanford HAI working with Michael Bernstein and Sanmi Koyejo.
I recently completed my PhD at MIT CSAIL where I was advised by David Karger.
I design and build novel social computing systems. Many of these systems re-imagine the design of social media and more broadly the web to give users more agency. I believe one of the implications of this greater user empowerment can be a higher credibility of content.

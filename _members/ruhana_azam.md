Ruhana is a 5th year Ph.D student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and currently a Visiting Student Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University advised by Sanmi Koyejo. Ruhana’s current research lies in searching large unknown spaces to improve phenotype selection plant breeding predictions. More broadly her interests lie in search algorithms, bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning.
Previously, she received her B.S in Computer Science (’19) from Purdue University where her interests were in modeling and improving medication adherence behavior with interventions.

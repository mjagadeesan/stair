I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, working with Prof. Gagandeep Singh. Currently, I am broadly interested in exploring different aspects of trustworthiness in machine learning.

Before that, I got my Master of Science degree in the same department. My Master research concentrates on federated learning for healthcare applications, with a focus on federated domain adaptation (FDA) problem both empirically and theoretically, advised by Prof. Sanmi Koyejo. I completed my undergraduate study from ZJU-UIUC Institute at International Campus of Zhejiang University located in Haining, Zhejiang, China. As a student of ZJU-UIUC Institute dual-degree program, I got a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering with Highest Honors from ECE Department of UIUC and Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Zhejiang University.
